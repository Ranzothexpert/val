                        Dear Nyo Nyoo,<br>


                        Happy valentines day babyyyy, I'm so happy to be able to celebrate another valentines day with you, together this time.
                        I know I did this letter last valentines, but I think I want to make this into a tradition for every year hehe. 
                        A letter can serve as a reminder to you on my appreciation and importance towards this relationship, in case I haven't been
                        able to show it. So heres to 
                        90 more letters. Hopefully your react tutorials can help me create better more interactive letters in the near future! 
                        <br><br>
                        I just really wanna 
                        cherish this day with you, although we may not be doing anything too special, I wanna spend every moment appreciating and celebrating
                        this beautiful connection that we have together. Valentines aside, not a day goes by where I do not think about just how incredibly lucky I am to be
                        able to call you my girl, my partner in crime forever. 

                        <br><br>

                        I know I have been flawed as a boyfriend, and our relationship is not all sunshine and rainbows. There were 
                        plenty of times where we got into each other's nerves. But if theres
                        anyone that I want to fight for with every joules of energy that I have, its you. Nothing makes sense without you, and I 
                        do not see myself living my life to the fullest without you in it. I want to experience every wonders of life, every bit of success, and
                        happiness, and sadness, and everything that this world has to offer - with you. Although the future may be rocky, I'm looking forward to
                        go through every step of the way holding your hands. I believe that there is no problem that we can't face together, and that all roads
                        will lead us back to each other no matter what (corny).

                        <br><br>

                        I love you so much for reasons that I've told you everyday. You just make me the happiest man ever, and seeing you smile
                        brings the biggest joy to my heart. I hope I can spend the rest of my life, bringing an abundance of joy to your world everyday,
                        as you have done for me too. I admit you can be a nuisance, but never stop being who you are, as that is the person
                        that I love with every bit of my soul. Heres to more movie nights, dates, licking battles, autistic moments,
                        cooking, food, memories, sexy time(hehe), and many more with you. I hope I was able to make your day a tiny bit better with this, lets have a fun
                        day yea. Do me a favor and make a collection of these letters for us to read back in 50 years okay? See you next valentinessss
